## Welcome
Here you will find an **unoficial** collection of documents which you might find useful in flight pre-planning, or for educational reasons.

This is currently a work in progress - I will be adding more documents over time, and trying to keep them updated as necessary; **however, as PIC you must verify all flight planning information with the POH and other official materials.**
